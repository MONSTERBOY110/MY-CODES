## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

Hello! I'm **Monster** (aka Subhojyoti Maity), an undergraduate student pursuing **B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering**.

I created this repository as a digital archive of my learning journey — from writing my very first "Hello World" in C to building structured solutions across multiple programming languages.

I believe in:
- 📈 **Consistent practice** over time
- 📚 **Clarity in fundamentals**
- 🧠 **Learning by doing and sharing**

Feel free to explore, reuse, and learn from the files here. Feedback and discussions are always welcome!
